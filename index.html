        Rachel catches the same commuter train every morning. She knows it will
        wait at the same signal each time, overlooking a row of back gardens.
        She’s even started to feel like she knows the people who live in one of
        the houses. “Jess and Jason,” she calls them. Their life—as she sees
        it—is perfect. If only Rachel could be that happy. And then she sees
        something shocking. It’s only a minute until the train moves on, but
        it’s enough. Now everything’s changed. Now Rachel has a chance to become
        a part of the lives she’s only watched from afar. Now they’ll see; she’s
        much more than just the girl on the train...Rachel Watson is a
        33-year-old listless alcoholic, reeling from the end of her marriage to
        Tom, who left her for another woman. Rachel's drinking has caused her to
        lose her job; she frequently binges and has blackouts. While drunk, she
        often harasses Tom, though she has little or no memory of these acts
        once she sobers up. Tom is now married to Anna Boyd and has a daughter
        with her, Evie – a situation that fuels Rachel's self-destructive
        tendencies, as it was her inability to conceive a child that began her
        spiral into alcoholism. Rachel follows her old routine of taking the
        train to and from London every day, one at 8:04 in the morning and the
        other at 5:56 in the evening.

        <p>Several months after solving the Lula Landry case, Cormoran Strike is asked by Leonora Quine to locate her novelist husband Owen, a controversial figure whose attempts to recreate the success of his first novel have failed. Owen disappeared around the same time his latest book, Bombyx Mori, was leaked. The book has been deemed unpublishable due to its mixture of sexual assault, torture, and cannibalism as well as its slanderous depiction of the people in Owen's life. Strike sets out interviewing the others portrayed in the manuscript: Owen's lover Kathryn Kent and her ward Phillip "Pippa" Midgley, both aspiring writers, Quine's agent Elizabeth Tassel, editor Jerry Waldegrave, publisher Daniel Chard and Quine's former friend Michael Fancourt, a famous author. The suspects, however, soon turn on one another, accusing each other of killing Owen and ghost-writing Bombyx Mori.

          As the investigation proceeds, Strike's relationship with his assistant Robin Ellacott grows strained, as she feels neglected by him and he feels unwilling to put her in a position where she is forced to choose between her job and her fiancé Matthew. The animosity is tempered when Strike finds Owen's body, which has been mutilated, doused in acid and posed to resemble the killing of the protagonist at the end of Bombyx Mori. Metropolitan Police later arrest Leonora for the murder, prompting Strike to set out to clear her name. Robin's relationship with Matthew comes under pressure when his mother dies and their wedding is delayed, and she almost misses the funeral to help Strike. She later confronts Strike about his intentions only to be warned that she will be asked to do things Matthew will not like if she becomes an investigator.
          
          With evidence against Leonora mounting, Strike focuses on Fancourt, whose character in the manuscript is inconsistent and seems contrary to his relationship with Owen. Several years earlier, after Fancourt's wife Elspeth wrote a novel that was panned by critics, an anonymous parody's release prompted her to kill herself. Fancourt accused Owen of authoring the parody and Tassel of enabling him. Strike soon deduces Bombyx Mori is a metaphor for someone else's life, its author pretending to be Owen, and he engineers a plan to catch the killer. With his half-brother Alexander's help, he approaches Fancourt at a party and asks to speak to him in private. When Tassel joins them, Strike reveals that he knows Tassel wrote the fake Bombyx Mori and killed Owen.
          
          Owen had been blackmailing Tassel, a failed author herself, for twenty years over her authorship of the parody of Elspeth's novel. When he approached her with the original concept for Bombyx Mori, Tassel concocted an elaborate plan. She conspired with Owen to stage his disappearance, rewrote Bombyx Mori, killed Owen, and framed Leonora for the murder. Tassel attempts to flee, only to be caught in a plan devised by Strike with Robin and Alexander and arrested.
          
          The following week, Leonora is released from prison, Fancourt acknowledges the original Bombyx Mori manuscript's literary value and plans to write an introduction for its publication, and Strike tells Robin that he has enrolled her in investigative training courses as a Christmas gift.</p>
